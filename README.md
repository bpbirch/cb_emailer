# cb_emailer
This module combines a mix of classes, dataframes, dictionaries, and functions whose purpose is to take CSVs of companies and people obtained from CrunchBase Open Data Map (ODM) and ultimately allow the user to send customized emails to people in those companies. The end product could have a number of uses, especially for job seekers or recruiters hoping to contact hiring managers within companies. A modified version of this product would be much more targeted, because it would utilize CrunchBase's Enterprise API, but I did not have $15000 to pay for that.  One major note on this module is that I have thus far not been able to find a decent method of verifying the existence of email addresses. I worked around this by, in sendAndCheck, following a process of sending an email to eg person@email.com, then waiting 60 senconds and then checking my email inbox for a bounceback, then if there is a bounceback, checking whether that bounceback was from person@email.com. If not, then I'm counting that email as a valid email. There are clearly a number of issues with this approach, given the variability of how bouncebacks are sent from different servers, including the time required to send them. Hence, I need to find a better approach than this.
